# Utilities

A set of functions designed to be littered everywhere.

## What's Available

-   [$](./$/README.md) - run a bash command in Node
-   [config](./config/README.md) - read and write to a configuration file
-   [env](./env/README.md) - read and write to a `.env` for use with Environment variables
-   [log](./log/README.md) - a logger
-   [node](./node/README.md) - interact with node packages

## Rules

-   There should be no logging; all Utilities should rely on what is returned, no thrown errors, only returns
