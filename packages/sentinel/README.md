# `@theholocron/sentinel`

Holocron's minimal GitHub App — webhook receiver, default-branch-only
`holocron.config.ts` validation, custom-properties sync, one check run per
resolution run.

> A sentinel droid: it watches, validates, and reports — never acts on its
> own. The webhook receiver and check-run posting land in follow-up PRs
> once the deploy target is decided — see `.notes/tech-sentinel-v1.spec.md`
> (repo root) for the full design and what's still open.

## Scope (v1)

- Webhook receiver: installation events, push to default branch, PR
  opened/synchronize.
- Read `holocron.config.ts` from a repo's default branch only — never a PR
  branch or fork (hard security boundary, D4/D6 in the epic spec). **Done**
  — `validateConfig()`.
- Sync resolved capabilities/profile to GitHub custom properties, extending
  the `syncProperties()` mechanism `@theholocron/holocron-plugin-github`
  already implements.
- Post a single check run reflecting capability-compliance status.

Explicitly out of v1 — tracked in
[#674](https://github.com/theholocron/holocron/issues/674): the App
autonomously triggering autofix PRs or PR comments from a webhook event,
and dashboards.

## `validateConfig({ client, repo })`

Fetches `holocron.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs,json}` (TS-first probe order) from
`repo`'s default branch via `@theholocron/github-client`'s
`git.getContents()` — which takes no `ref` parameter, so it structurally
can never read a PR branch or fork — and validates its `tasks` array
against `@theholocron/astromech`'s canonical task registry. Returns one of:

| `status`          | Meaning                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"valid"`         | Config loaded; every task name is in the registry.              |
| `"no-config"`     | No `holocron.config.*` in any probed extension.                 |
| `"unknown-tasks"` | Config loaded; `unknownTasks` lists names outside the registry. |
| `"load-error"`    | A `holocron.config.*` exists but couldn't be parsed/executed.   |

Execution reuses `@theholocron/datapad`'s `loadConfigFromContent()`
(fetched content, not a file already on disk — the same `loadFile`
internals `loadConfigFile()` uses locally for `holocron setup`/`sync`,
D8) — so a real
`holocron.config.ts` that does
`import { defineConfig } from "@theholocron/cli"` (the CLI README's own
documented pattern) resolves correctly; the fetched content is written to
a temp directory under this package's own tree specifically so that
upward `node_modules` resolution finds it.

## Development

| Script                                  | Description                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm run delivery.build`               | Bundle with tsdown                          |
| `pnpm run verification.unitTests`       | Run the vitest suite (always with coverage) |
| `pnpm run verification.typeSafety`      | `tsc --noEmit`                              |
| `pnpm run sourceQuality.staticAnalysis` | ESLint                                      |
